For doing the Text Analysis, a text or an article(to be analysed) is to be selected.
The selected Article should be converted into various sections according to the meaning.
The meanings of each sentence should be noted.
Sentences with similar meanings will form a section.
In this way, the whole article or text get sectionised.
Each section will be analysed using any qualitative analysis.
For instance, Discourse Analysis will be applied on each section.
